## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

- **Dynamic QR Code Generation:** Upgrade from static QR codes to dynamic ones. Dynamic QR codes can be edited or updated without changing the QR code itself. Users can log in to your website, manage their QR codes, and modify the linked content. This feature is valuable for businesses that want to keep their QR code information current without creating new codes each time.

- **Analytics and Insights Dashboard:** Develop a robust analytics and insights dashboard for users. When users create QR codes through your website, they can track and analyze metrics such as the number of scans, geographic locations of scans, and the time and date of scans. This data can be valuable for businesses to measure the effectiveness of their QR code campaigns and make data-driven decisions.
